- I'm a software engineer with a rich experience collaborating with US-based startups.
- Most of my production code was in Python 🐍 and JS/TypeScript, but I would love more opportunities with Rust ![Rust logo](https://www.rust-lang.org/logos/rust-logo-16x16-blk.png) or go.
- Interested in distributed systems, *nix, Rust.
- 🧩 I admire the pureness of math. In part, that's why I'm a fan of functional programming and type systems like Rust or Scala have.
- 📚 I love teaching and have held public lectures and workshops.
